            <p className="">
                Graduating in Science In Information Technology and majoring in Interaction design at the University of Technology Sydney, enabled me to pursue my passion as a developer. Post university I continued my learning completing online courses, took on freelance projects and participated in Generation Australia's Junior Web Developer Program. Aside from coding, I love to play basketball, hit the gym, listen to podcasts and meditate. 
                I enjoy learning, building things and creating meaningful experiences for the user.
